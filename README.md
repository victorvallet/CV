## Victor Vallet

Having just finished my MSc in Entrepreneurship, I have been running a web design agency in France for a year. As we totally shifted and needed a web application, I started to learn JavaScript and the Vue.js framework on my own as well as Firestore cloud by Google. I almost finished to develop the first beta version of our platform, but I really wanted to join Makers to become more confident, practice problem solving, and and strenghten my understanding and knwoledge of programming.
